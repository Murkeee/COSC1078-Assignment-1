              <h4> MUSIC </h4>
              <p> I am a current piano student training in classical music. I only began learning in 2021 but I am currently practising for the ABRSM Grade 4 Piano exam. Although Classical music is my main area of study for the Piano, I do listen to a variety of musical genres other than Classical. You can check out the type of music I usually listen to on my Spotify below.</p>

            <h4> PC BUILDING </h4>
            <p> I sometimes build PCs for myself or friends as a hobby and as paid work. It’s very satisfying to see a PC come to life for the first time especially when someone has dumped a truck load of money into it and you're hoping that everything goes well after assembly. I started building PCs when I was 12 so I don’t have a picture of all of the PCs I have built but here are some images of the PCs I have built recently for myself and others: (My friends are really bad at taking pictures, sorry) </p>

            My interest in IT began at the age of 4 when I was indoctrinated into the gaming world, playing games like Starfox 64 and Super Mario 64, this was my first interaction with anything related to IT and later led me to owning several Nintendo consoles and a first-generation iPod touch when those released and finally a PC. Although my first PC’s specs weren’t anything to brag about it introduced me to the world of PC gaming and Windows where I learnt all about the frustrations and troubleshooting of computers and the Windows operating system. Before long, I built my first PC and began building PCs for close friends and acquaintances as well as troubleshooting and meddling in coding. I believe my interest in the networking side of IT really stems from my past ‘trauma’ (for a lack of a better term) of having to deal with crappy internet and improper networking at home leading to me having to solve the problem.

        <div class="body">
          <p style="padding-bottom: 30px; padding-top: 30px;">
            my ideal job would be as a Network Infrastructure Architect or a content creator. I believe Network architecture would be a great job for me as its generally on a contractual basis and therefore I have more freedom than I would with a regular ‘nine-to-five’ job and allows me to put my practical and logical skills to use designing and maintaining IT infrastructure for companies and campuses. Content creation is also an option as (similarly to Network Architecture) it not only allows me to put my practical and logical thinking skills to use but also gives me an opportunity to share with others my hobbies, interests and non-IT related knowledge and practices. An example of a job listing id find interesting is below:
          </p>
          <img style="padding-bottom: 30px;" src="./img/job.png" width="800" style="padding:15px;"></a>
          <p style="padding-bottom: 30px">
            The reason I believe content creation could also be a possible job option is because I am quite creatively oriented despite my outward appearance which I think would say otherwise. I also love sharing my hobbies and projects with people and content creation is another way to do just that. Content creation would also be a great way to put my background experience in the adobe suite and especially Adobe After effects to use.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-bottom: 30px">
          I closely identify my current skillset with the saying “Jack of all trades, master of none” As I don’t believe I have yet mastered any one specific talent but do have many. If I could choose one specific skill to master, it would greatly benefit my marketability as an employee. I intend on completing the CompTIA certifications including A+, Network+, and Security+ and the related CISCO certifications including the 'CCNA' once I have graduated from my undergraduate degree to further prove my skills and interest in the IT networking field.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-bottom: 30px">
            I will make the best of my time in university to solidify my choice and further obtain knowledge, hard skills and soft skills related to my choice of field. I also intended on beginning content creation on the side as it is also an avenue to gain more skills and maybe some money on the side.

            According to <a href ="https://16personalities.com"><u>16 personalities.com</u></a> my MBTI personality type is ‘ISTP-T’. I don’t believe this completely accurately represents my weaknesses, but it does a good job of representing my strengths. <a href="https://how-to-study.com"><u>how-to-study.com</u></a> states that my ‘learning style’ is visual and <a href="https://truity.com"><u>truity.com</u></a> states that my work style is 'Humanitarian' and 'Innovator'.
          </p>
          <img style="width: 600px; padding-top: 20px;"src=".\img\MBTI.png">
          <p style="padding-top: 20px">
            Although I believe these tests aren’t entirely accurate (as I believe one person does not fit entirely into one of the 16 personalities but rather, they fit somewhere between two) they can give a good sense of idea on the type of person someone is in the workplace. I believe my results show that I have a positive attitude when it comes to problem solving especially if it's problem solving in a creative way and that like truity.com states, I am driven to make the world a better place using creative solutions and solving problems using analytical skills to improve logical systems. I don’t believe in the 'learning styles' as I think that it’s always beneficial to have more than one stream of information when learning something new as such although my outcome for learning styles from how-to-study.com is 'visual' I think that I still benefit greatly from learning styles of all forms. Furthermore, although '16personalities.com' assigned me the introvert trait I do find myself as being somewhere between introverted and extraverted.
