              <h4> MUSIC </h4>
              <p> I am a current piano student training in classical music. I only began learning in 2021 but I am currently practising for the ABRSM Grade 4 Piano exam. Although Classical music is my main area of study for the Piano i do listen to a variety of musical genres other than Classical. You can check out the type of music i usually listen to on my Spotify below.</p>

            My interest in IT began at the age of 4 when i was indoctrinated into the gaming world, playing games like Starfox 64 and Super Mario 64 and even... Dora the explorer on the “V.Smile” console (Dont ask) This was my first interaction with anything related to IT and later led me to owning serveral Nintendo consoles and a first generation ipod touch when those released and finally a PC. Although my first PC’s specs werent anything to brag about it introduced me to the world of PC gaming and Windows where i learnt all about the frustrations and troubleshooting of computers and the Windows operating system. Before long, i built my first PC and began building PC’s for close friends and acquaintances as well as troubleshooting and began meddlling in coding.

            my ideal job would be as a Network Infrastructure Architect or a content creator. I believe Network  architecture would be a great job for me as its generally on a contractural basis and therefore i have more freedom than i would with a regular ‘nine-to-five’ job and allows me to put my practical and logical skills to use designing and maintaining IT infrastructure for companies and campuses. Content creation is also an option as (similarly to Network Architecture) it not only allows me to put my practical and logical thinking skills to use but also gives me an oppurtunity to share with others my hobbies, interests and non IT related knowledge and practices.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-bottom: 30px">
            I closesly identify my current skillset with the saying “Jack of all trades, master of none” As i dont believe i have yet mastered any one specific talent but do have many. This is a ‘double edged sword’ as while i have many skills obtained from hobbies not many of these skills are specifically marketable. If i could choose one specific skill to master it would greatly benefit my marketability as an employee. I intend on completing the CompTIA certifications including A+, Network+, and Security+ once i have graduated from my undergraduate degree to further prove my skills and interest in the IT field.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-bottom: 30px">
            To improve my situation it would be ideal for me to select a skill and master it, right now i am not sure exactly what that skill is but my guess is something to do with netowrking and IT infrastructure.  I will make the best of my time in Univeristy to solidify my choice and further obtain knowledge, hard skills and soft skills related to my choice of field.

            According to ‘16personalities.com’ my MBTI personality type is ‘ISTP-T’. Although i dont believe this completely accurately represents my weaknesses, it does a good job of representing my strengths. The ISTP personality type also known as the ‘Virtuoso’ is considered  ‘how-to-study.com’ states that my ‘learning style’ is visual.
