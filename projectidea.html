        Overview

      <p>
        The Overall idea of this project is to create a ‘smart mirror’ implementation which will:
      <p>  a)	Activate upon the detection of a user in front of the mirror (motion detection will likely be used) </p>
      <p>  b)	Collect and display important daily information such as the weather, current news events or user chosen news topics. </p>
      <p>  c)	Use the collected data to help the user determine the best course of action for skincare and clothing-choice for any given day. </p>
        Its also intended for the product to have user customizability and personalization options which can be controlled using the matching mobile application which allows the user to adjust and alter the location of widgets, etc.

        Although many people have access to so much information in the palm of their hands, not all these people have the time or patience to go through multiple sites and google searches just to find this information. I believe this product will help eliminate the hassle by collecting and displaying information for the user with recommendations on clothing choice and skincare choices based on the collected information. Moreover, with the recent event of Covid-19 and its ‘lockdowns’ there has been a surge in the popularity of the already rapidly growing selfcare and skincare markets meaning more people are realizing the importance of selfcare and skincare this is evident in Morder Intelligence’s market report labelled <i>“Australia skin care products market – growth, trends, covid-19 impact, and forecasts (2022-2027)”</i> This is important because while there is a growth in the market it means there are also more people who simply use skincare products without a second thought because it might’ve been recommended to them by another person rather than having recommendations given based on user input and data. Another reason for this project is to reduce the screen usage time when waking up as I know many struggle with always checking their phone in the morning, this project will help to reduce the screen usage time by providing another method of getting the information you need to go throughout your day.
